# Retailer Invoice Verification and Order Requirements Document

This document represents a comprehensive analysis of requirements for an application aimed at assisting retailers with order management and invoice verification. The application is designed to streamline order entry, editing, and invoice discrepancy checking. By capturing customer needs effectively, I structured clear functional and technical requirements for a solution that aligns with retailersâ€™ operational workflows.

This project was a fantastic learning experience, as it allowed me to deepen my understanding of customer requirements, apply problem-solving strategies, and strengthen my skills in drafting technical documentation. The process of translating business needs into actionable requirements has given me valuable insight into the initial stages of software development, preparing me for more advanced projects in the future.
